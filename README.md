# aptBot

I will be moving soon and have been eyeing a specific apartment. I have preferences such as which side of the building I prefer, floor placement, pricing, and building. Instead of checking in daily manually or asking the apartment office, why not build a script/bot to do the work for us.
aptBot is a python script that will scrape a specific unit of an apartment I'm looking at and parse the pricing, building number, and floor level and return a list of the units that fit my needs.
